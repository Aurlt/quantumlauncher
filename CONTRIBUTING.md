# What you can do

## If you don't know how to code, you can:
- Find and report bugs or issues
- Give feedback about how this launcher could be improved
- Fix any typos or mistakes in anything (english isn't my first language)
- Most importantly, share this launcher with your friends!

## If you know how to code, you can:
- Well... write code. Add stuff. Don't worry about "quality"
  or fancy terms like that. This ain't the linux kernel, I'm here with you!
- Write documentation. See a public function, module, struct, enum, whatever
  that could help with some `///` doc comment? Go ahead!
- Contribute to the website (repo: <https://github.com/Mrmayman/Mrmayman.github.io>)
- Work on CI (github actions)
