# Forking QuantumLauncher – License Guidelines

QuantumLauncher is an open-source project licensed under the
[GNU General Public License v3.0 or GPLv3]((https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

Forking and modifying the project is entirely allowed.
In fact, open collaboration is encouraged!
However, to comply with the license (and respect the original project),
please follow these rules:

# What the GPLv3 Requires

- **Your fork must also be open source and licensed under GPLv3**:
  If you distribute modified versions (e.g. binaries or source),
  your version must also be open-source under the same license.

- **You must provide proper attribution**:
  Keep the copyright notice and license text.
  Acknowledge the original project, even if you make changes.

- **Avoid misrepresentation**:
  If you're turning your fork into a distinct project
  (with different branding), avoid using the name “QuantumLauncher”
  in ways that suggest affiliation or endorsement.

# On Monetisation/Competition

While GPLv3 does not prohibit monetisation,
aggressively promoting a minimally changed fork
or profiting off someone else's work without
significant improvement or credit is considered unethical
by the open-source community.
(*Yes, this has happened before*)
