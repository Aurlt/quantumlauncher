Contains some **precompiled native libraries** for certain platforms.
These were *manually compiled from source by me*, because
they're really hard/inconvenient to build on your own.

The launcher will `include_bytes!()` these libraries
(embedded into the executable) for ease of distribution.

> Note: A basic description of the environment is provided
so you can reproduce the build on your own, but it's
unlikely that you'll get matching binary-perfect builds.
